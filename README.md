# Pebmed iOS base architecture
This architecture aims to be a base for any iOS project developed in Pebmed apps. Any new contribution is welcomed.

## Repository structure
We basically use gitflow to manage the repository and the flow around it, you can find more here: [gitflow cheatsheet](https://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/)

### Commits
All commits should be made in English as this document suggests.

**Tips:**
1. Your branch should be deleted after being merged with develop
2. Every time before starting to work, make git pull to avoid trouble later

## Formatting and style
This project has configured Swift Lint in order to enforce code standards.
